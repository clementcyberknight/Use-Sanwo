## How Sanwo Auto Payment Schedule Work

Sanwo simplifies payroll management with its automated scheduled payment feature. Here's how it works under the hood:

1.  **Setting Up the Schedule:** Businesses configure their desired payment schedule through the Sanwo interface. This includes setting the:

    - **Payment Interval:** (e.g., Weekly, Monthly)
    - **Payment Day:**
      - **Monthly:** A specific date (e.g., the 15th), or "Last working day."
      - **Weekly:** A specific day of the week (e.g., Monday).

    Sanwo stores these settings within the business's document in Firebase.

2.  **Google Cloud Scheduler:** We utilize Google Cloud Scheduler to trigger a Cloud Functions endpoint on a recurring schedule. This schedule is set to "every day 00:00 UTC" to ensure daily checks for due payments.

3.  **Payroll Schedule Check:** When the Cloud Function is triggered (the `scheduledPayrollWorker` function), it performs the following steps:

    - **Fetches Businesses:** It retrieves all businesses from the "businesses" collection in Firestore.
    - **Iterates Through Businesses:** For each business, it checks:
      - If a `nextPaymentDate` is set.
      - If the `nextPaymentDate` is in the past (i.e., payroll is due).
    - **Processes Due Payrolls:** If payroll is due, the function:
      - **Fetches Workers:** Retrieves all active workers associated with that business from the "workers" subcollection.
      - **Processes Each Worker:** For each active worker with a defined salary and wallet address:
        - **Sends Payroll Data to API:** This step (using the `sendPayrollDataToAPI` function) is intended to trigger the actual payment (details below). It logs success or failure.
        - **Sends Worker Payment Email:** Notifies the worker via email that a payment has been processed. It also logs success or failure.
      - **Sends Company Payroll Report Email:** Sends a summary email to the business owner (or designated contact) with details of successful and failed payments.
      - **Calculates Next Payment Date:** Based on the `paymentInterval` and `paymentDay` settings, it determines the next payment date using the `calculateNextPaymentDate` function.
      - **Updates Firestore:**
        - Updates the `nextPaymentDate` in the business's document in the "businesses" collection.
        - Updates the "payroll_schedules" subcollection with the new `nextPaymentDate` and schedule information.

4.  **Admin Backend Wallet Signing:** Sanwo use an admin backend wallet that signs the worker salary payment when payroll is scheduled and release payment to worker .

5.  **Error Handling:** Throughout the process, the Cloud Function employs robust error handling and logging to ensure that any issues are captured and can be investigated.
